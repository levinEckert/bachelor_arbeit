A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.},

%	title = {Solving {Hard} {Combinatorial} {Optimization} {Problems} using {Cooperative} {Parallel} {Metaheuristics}},
%	abstract = {Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COP) are widely used to model and solve real-life problems in many different application domains. These problems represent a real challenge for the research community due to their inherent difficulty, as many of them are NP-hard. COPs are difficult to solve with exact methods due to the exponential growth of the problem’s search space with respect to the size of the problem. Metaheuristics are often the most efficient methods to make the hardest problems tractable. However, some hard and large real-life problems are still out of the scope of even the best metaheuristic algorithms. Parallelism is a straightforward way to improve metaheuristics performance. The basic idea is to perform concurrent explorations of the search space in order to speedup the search process. Currently, the most advanced techniques implement some communication mechanism to exchange information between metaheuristic instances in order to try and increase the probability to find a solution. However, designing an efficient cooperative parallel method is a very complex task, and many issues about communication must be solved. Furthermore, it is known that no unique cooperative configuration may efficiently tackle all problems. This is why there are currently efficient cooperative solutions dedicated to some specific problems or more general cooperative methods but with limited performances in practice.In this thesis we propose a general framework for Cooperative Parallel Metaheuristics (CPMH). This framework includes several parameters to control the cooperation. CPMH organizes the explorers into teams; each team aims at intensifying the search in a particular region of the search space and uses intra-team communication. In addition, inter-team communication is used to ensure search diversification. CPMH allows the user to tune the trade-off between intensification and diversification. However, our framework supports different metaheuristics and metaheuristics hybridization. We also provide X10CPMH, an implementation of our CPMH framework developed in the X10 parallel language. To assess the soundness of our approach we tackle two hard real-life COP: hard variants of the Stable Matching Problem (SMP) and the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). For all problems we propose new sequential and parallel metaheuristics, including a new Extremal Optimization-based method and a new hybrid cooperative parallel algorithm for QAP. All algorithms are implemented thanks to X10CPMH. A complete experimental evaluation shows that the cooperative parallel versions of our methods scale very well, providing high-quality solutions within a limited timeout. On hard and large variants of SMP, our cooperative parallel method reaches super-linear speedups. Regarding QAP, the cooperative parallel hybrid algorithm performs very well on the hardest instances, and improves the best known solutions of several instances.},
